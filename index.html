<p> What is patient autonomy?
It is the right of patients to make decisions. What rights do patients have in healthcare settings? The right to a reasonable response to your request and need for treatment or service, within the Facility's capacity, its stated mission, and applicable laws and regulations. How do healthcare providers ensure patients are informed and able to make decisions about their healthcare?
the anwer to this is a balanced discussion

<p> What could the hospital have done better to make sure the privacy breach would not happen. They should've made a rule where if you can't touch or share someone's medical information or they will get a serious consequence, or they should've put it in a place no one could've got it.What was the impact of the privacy breach. The hospital implemented stricter policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
